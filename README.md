This script presents a comprehensive implementation of the KMeans clustering algorithm, designed
to be both user-friendly and highly interactive. The script focuses on adapting to a broad range
of databases with a varying amount of features and visualizing every step the script takes, letting
the user understand the underlying process. It provides valuable tools for exploring and gaining
insights into the structure of complex datasets. 

The script is adapted from [morenobcn's capstone GitHub project](https://github.com/morenobcn/capstone_hotels_arcpy)
where he analyses hotel price clustering.

The database "Fires from Space: Australia" was uploaded by Carlos Paradis via "NASA FIRMS Archive Download" in the platform kaggle.
This database is related to remote sensing of fires. The file we have specifically relied on is the one related to the MODIS satellite: "fire_archive_M6_96619.csv".
